To run it make sure you have python installed
and run the following commands

pip install tweepy

pip install textBlob

python -m textblob.download_corpora

You may not have some libraries pre-installed on your PC so make sure to install them through pip command

If you can't run it through terminal then use PyCharm IDE.
